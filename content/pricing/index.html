        <h4>Brand Development</h4>
        <h5>Begins at $3000.00</h5>
        <p>
        Is your business not growing as quickly as you’d like? Does 
        your brand lack a plan? Do you feel vaguely ashamed when- 
        ever you point someone to your website? Do you even 
        know where to begin? 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you feel that nothing in your visual arsenal accurately
        represents your business to the world, but you’re not even
        sure how to being fixing it, the brand development package
        is for you. Together, we will take a realistic look at your
        brand (or lack thereof) and come up with a plan for what
        you need to put your best foot forward. Although each
        business requires its own unique solution, this all inclusive
        package often starts with logo design, website design and
        development, and packaging design, and gets down to the
        nitty gritty details - like Facebook icons, business cards,
        what fonts to use in your business correspondence, and
        other ways to make your business stand apart from the
        crowd.

        <p>
        A phone consultation to help diagnose your biggest brand
        problems - before you can afford a full time designer. I’ll
