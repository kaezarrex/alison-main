        <h3>Brand Development</h3>
        <p>
        If you’ve carefully thought about every aspect of your business except for the branding, this is the package for you. Together we will take a realistic look at your business, and come up with a plan for what you need to put your best step forward. Although each business present its own unique challenges, I’ve come up with method to get your brand on the right track:
        </p>
        <p>
        We start off with a 30 minute consultation about your business, and what you hope to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
        I provide you with a detailed proposal outlining the areas we will work to improve – and our timeline from zero to finished. This can range from big picture items like a logo or website to nitty gritty details like your Facebook business page icon.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once you’ve signed off on the proposal, I get to work, checking in along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
        The final result: Brand materials that are perfectly tailored to your business’s unique needs, and outstanding design work that you’re proud to share with your customers!

        <h3>Brand Consultation</h3>
        <p>
         If you’re just starting out, or simply wary of making a big investment without doing more research, schedule a brand and style consultation with me!
        </p>
        <p>
         We talk about your specific business, action steps you can take on your own to make your brand instantly more cohesive, and I can answer any questions or concerns you may have. For $150 dollars you will receive:
         A 60 minute, one on one phone, skype, or in person (if you’re local!) conversation with me.
         A pdf for you to keep, detailing what we discussed, and the action steps I’ve suggested (so you don’t have to worry about keeping notes while we talk.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The best part? If, after the consultation you are unsatisfied with your experience, I will give you a full refund.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Weddings</h3>
        <p>
            As an invitation designer, I’ve worked with enough brides and grooms to know that wedding planning can be quite the project. I like to try to make your life a little easier by helping you navigate a process that can be somewhat confusing and intimidating - your wedding stationery. I can take you through the fun steps of the process, coming up with creative designs unique to your relationship (and your budget) and handling the rest - suggesting the best printing methods, finding the best papers, and answering any stationery related questions along the way.
