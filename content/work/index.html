<h4>Ottersen</h4>
<p>
    Everything in this wedding suite is handmade. I hand lettered all of the text and edge painted the programs. We used bright accents, like hot pink envelopes lined with patterned paper and bright orange vellum response envelopes.

    I also wanted to include watercolor elements, so I painted the lettering on the RSVP. I also did watercolor washes on the ceremony programs and each individual element of the invitation suite.
