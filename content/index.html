    <p class="span5 offset1">
    Listens to your creative vision, and takes it beyond
    what you ever dreamed it could be.
    <br><br>
    Remembers all the little details that make a design
    stand out - so you don’t have to.
    <br><br>
    Can help you define the problem - whether you need a
    new website, new packaging, or a complete brand over-
    haul.
    <br><br>
    Makes the process easy - all you have to do is make the
    fun decisions.

    Working as a small business means that it’s really
    important to get things right - which is why hiring a
    designer to put together your collateral can be your
    best option. Working together means you feel like my
    one and only customer - and together, we come up
    with the best solutions for your business. Instead of
    throwing something together piecemeal - come away
    with a carefully orchestrated plan for branding your
    business just right. Your website should relate to
    your labels should relate to your invoices visually -
    and I can help you with that. Let’s get started.
