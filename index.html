                            <span class="first-word">Although</span> I have lived in Raleigh for most of my life, I am
                            hopeless at imitating a Southern accent. It is the little things that bring me
                            the most joy, from buying new shampoo, taking polaroid pictures of
                            my favorite people and places, anything made on a letterpress,
                            (especially if I'm the one making it) die cuts, sparkly paper, cable
                            television and office supplies, particularly post-it notes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I try to make the most of Raleigh's beautiful weather by being out-
                            doors as much as possible, but if I'm not outside, you can probably find
                            me hunched over the computer, working on a design project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since graduating from North Carolina State University in 2010, I have
                            been putting my bachelor's degree in graphic design to good use. My
                            goal is to help make the world a place where great graphic design is
                            the standard, not the exception. With each project, I strive to continue
                            my education, and grow in my passion. Nothing makes me happier
                            than a job well done, and I won't stop working until I'm happy.
