                        Although I have lived in Raleigh for most of my life, I am hope-
                        less at imitating a Southern accent. It is the little things that bring me
                        the most joy, from buying new shampoo, taking polaroid pictures of
                        my favorite people and places, anything made on a letterpress,
                        (especially if I'm the one making it) die cuts, sparkly paper, cable
                        television and office supplies, particularly post-it notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I try to make the most of Raleigh's beautiful weather by being out-
                        doors as much as possible, but if I'm not outside, you can probably find
                        me hunched over the computer, working on a design project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since graduating from North Carolina State University in 2010, I have
                        been putting my bachelor's degree in graphic design to good use. My
                        goal is to help make the world a place where great graphic design is
                        the standard, not the exception. With each project, I strive to continue
                        my education, and grow in my passion. Nothing makes me happier
                        than a job well done, and I won't stop working until I'm happy.
